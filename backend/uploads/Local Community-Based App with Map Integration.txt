### **Example Workflow for Map-Based Features:**

1. **User Signs Up and Enters Location**:
   - Upon sign-up, the user enters their address or allows geolocation tracking to find their current location.
   
2. **Map Displays Community Markers**:
   - The map shows all local events, businesses, and alerts within the user’s specified radius.
   - Users can click on a marker to see more details (e.g., event info, business deals).

3. **User Interacts with Map**:
   - The user clicks on an event marker and RSVPs to attend.
   - They receive directions via the app and a reminder closer to the event date.

4. **Real-Time Alert Posting**:
   - A user sees a lost pet and immediately posts a neighborhood alert, which appears as a marker on the map for nearby users.
   
5. **Business Interaction**:
   - A user notices a deal from a local business on the map and clicks on the marker to redeem a special offer.

### **Next Steps:**
- You can begin by integrating **Google Maps API** or **Mapbox** into your application.
- Break down the development of the map-based features into phases, starting with basic geolocation and marker functionality.
- Once the map works, layer on additional features like filtering, event creation, real-time updates, and user interaction.

This architecture will help you build a feature-rich local community app that enhances real-world connections through a powerful map integration.
